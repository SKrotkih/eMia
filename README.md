## Introduction

eMia is a simple social network. 
You can sign in, sign up, sign out, restore the password, edit profile, add a new post (title, body, photo),  filter posts.
You will get  push-notification if another user likes your post.

eMia uses Firebase database, storage, authentication and cloud messages.
