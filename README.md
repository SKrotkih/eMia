## Introduction

eMia is a simple social network. 
You can sign in, sign up, sign out, restore password, edit profile, add a new post (title, body, photo),  filter posts.
You will get  push-notification if another user likes your post.

eMia uses Firebase database, storage, authentication and cloud messages.

Notes. This React Native version contains also some native things. For example there is Filter View Controller (iOS, Swift 5) which is launched with using options menu button.  

## Requirements

- Xcode 11, Swift 5
- Android Studio 3.1
