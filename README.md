## Introduction

There are also two native example apps: 
[eMia-iOS](https://github.com/SKrotkih/eMia-iOS) 
[eMia-Android](https://github.com/SKrotkih/eMia-Android).

eMia is a simple social network. 
You can be registered there, then edit your profile, post a new topic with a title, description and a photo.
You will get  push-notification if another user likes your post.

eMia uses Firebase database, storage, authentication and cloud messages.

Notes. This React Native version contains also some native things. For example there is Filter View Controller (iOS, Swift 5) which is launched by options menu button (React Native  component).
